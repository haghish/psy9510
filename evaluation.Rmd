Learning R with Markdown
============================================================

In this course, I introduced you to R Markdown. Also, during the lectures, 
I asked you to use R Markdown as a notebook, to write the R code that you learn 
in the class and explain it to yourself in your own way. Below, I ask some 
open-end questions **to evaluate your experience of the class (not the course itself, your experience about learning R with RMarkdown)**. This feedback is 
very valuable to me as I would like to refine this method of teaching, understand its strength 
and weakneces, how difficult it was for you to get started with it, did you enjoy 
working with it, and whether do you think you will continue using it in the future. 
Please take your timewrite your answers below and email this Markdown back to me. 
**This is NOT the course evaluation. It is a qualitative study that I wish to carry out to learn about your experiences during this course. It is NOT a part of your course assessment and your participation is completely voluntary.**.

free to write as much as you like
