## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# DAY 2 

## Loops: 
For repeating data with one short formula instead of typing down everything. 
For cleaning of data. Using the function:
for (variable in vector) {
  print (variable)
}
```{r}
for (b in 1:5){
  print(b)
}
```

```{r}
S <- c("some", "character", "for", "the", "example")
S
for (indiancurry in S) {
  print(indiancurry)
}
```

```{r}
for (b in 1:5) {
  print(S[b])
}
```

## Saving data
For reading r data: data(iris) - SaveRDS (iris, "testdata.RDS). 
```{r}
data(iris)
saveRDS(iris, "test.RDS")
```

## List objects
ls and objects return a vector of character strings giving the names of the objects in the specified environment.
```{r}
ls()
```

## Read data format 
CSV common data files from internet, separated by comma or similar. write.csv saves the selected file. Unlink removes the selected files. Read.csv()
```{r}
data(iris)
write.csv(iris, file = "iristest.csv")
getwd()
unlink("iristest.csv")
readRDS("test.RDS")

```

## Reading stata data 

```{r}
library(readstata13)
library(foreign)
library(haven)
```

## Reading excel
read_excel() calls excel_format() to determine if path is xls or xlsx, based on the file extension and the file itself, in that order. Use read_xls() and read_xlsx() directly if you know better and want to prevent such guessing.
```{r}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
readxl_example("clippy.xls")
xlsx_example <- readxl_example("datasets.xlsx")
read_excel(xlsx_example)
excel_sheets(xlsx_example)
read_excel(xlsx_example, sheet = "chickwts")
```

## Subset
Extracting information from a data set. subset(x, subset, ...)
```{r}
subset(airquality, Temp > 80, select = c(Ozone, Temp))
subset(airquality, Day == 1, select = -Temp)
subset(airquality, select = Ozone:Wind)
subset(airquality, Day == 1, select = -c(Temp, Wind))
```
colnames() and rownames(). Retrieve or set the row or column names of a matrix-like object.

## Factor
The function factor is used to encode a vector as a factor (the terms ‘category’ and ‘enumerated type’ are also used for factors). If argument ordered is TRUE, the factor levels are assumed to be ordered. 
```{r}
is.factor(airquality$Temp)
```

## Reading and writing **SPSS** datasets in R

**BE CAREFUL WITH VARIABLES THAT HAVE LABELS**. They might be converted to factor (nominal) variables, even if they are stored as numeric on SPSS. 

### Write a SPSS file from an R object

```{r}
data("airquality")
haven::write_sav(data=airquality, path="airquality.sav")
```

### Read a SPSS file into R

```{r}
df <- haven::read_sav(file = "airquality.sav")
str(df)
library(pander)
pander(head(df))
```

## Summary 
Using the functions view(), data()
```{r}
colnames(attenu)
rownames(attenu)
vec <- colnames(attenu)
length(vec)
class(vec)
vec[3]
vec2 <- vec[3:1]
summary(attenu, digits = 4)
```


## NA (null): 
NA is a logical constant of length 1 which contains a missing value indicator
```{r}
if (is.numeric(iris$Species)) {
  mean(iris$Species) 
} else {
  str(iris$Species)
}
is.na(attenu$station)
length(is.na(attenu$station)) #length is the whole vector
sum(is.na(attenu$station)) #number of missing values 
```

## Plot
```{r}
plot(cars$dist)
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

## After Lunch

```{r}
for (pasta in vec) {
  print(pasta)
  
}

```

paste () Concatenate vectors after converting to character. paste(1:12)

substr() Extract or replace substrings in a character vector. substr(x, start, stop)

nchar() number of characters

strsplit() Split the elements of a character vector x into substrings according to the matches to substring split within them. strsplit(x, split, fixed = FALSE, perl = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE). strsplit("cooked tofu", split = " ")
[1] "cooked" "tofu" 

Which() Give the TRUE indices of a logical object, allowing for array indices. 

## Stringr 
One of the packages of tidyverse. 
Have 7 functions: str_detect/count/subset/locate/extract/match/replace 
```{r}
library(stringr)
x <- c("why", "video", "cross", "extra", "deal", "authority")
str_length(x)
nchar(x[1])
```

Summary: we learned the formula for loops, reading and saving files from csv, excel and SPSS, subsetting parts of a data set and some other small functions such as summary, length, names of the rows and the columns.
