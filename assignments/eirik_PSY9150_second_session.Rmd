## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


For Loops
===============================

For loops can be used to repeat an action/function several times. It is especially useful for performing a function on big datasets 

```{r}

# a for loop 
for(b in 1:5){print(b)}

S <- c("some", "character", "for", "the", "example")

# 
for(b in 1:5) 
  {(print(S[b]))}


# the variable gets assigned inside the loop so you can call it anything 
for(indiancurry in S) {print(indiancurry)}      

```

The variable "indiancurry" or "b" is assigned insided the loop and therefore does not need to be assigned beforehand.  


Working with data
===============================


SaveRDS saves data into a RDS-file 
RDS is used for saving and loading a single object


```{r}
help(readRDS)
help(saveRDS)

data(iris)
saveRDS(iris, "testdata.RDS")
```



Cleaning workspace
-----------------------

```{r}
ls()
help(ls)

rm()
```

ls() lists the variables and dataframes in the global environment 

rm(variable) removes specific objects from the global environment


CSV data format
--------------------------

read.csv reads the csv file into r. It can be read directly from the web if we have the URL. Unlink removes files from wd

```{r}
help("read.csv")
data(iris)

write.csv(iris, file = "iristest.csv")
help("unlink")

```

Subsetting 
===================================

The `subset`function returns a subset of vectors, matrices or data frames which meet conditions 


```{r}
assign(x = "df2", value = "testdata.RDS")


data(airquality)
dim(airquality)
str(airquality)
help(subset)

subset(airquality, Temp > 80, select = c(Ozone, Temp))
subset(airquality, Day == 1, select = -Temp)
subset(airquality, select = Ozone:Wind)

subset(airquality, select = -c(Temp, Ozone))

help(colnames)
```

Stata and spss data
============================

```{r}

library(readstata13)
library(foreign)
library(haven)

help("read.spss")

help("read.dta13")

is.factor(airquality$temp)
class(airquality$temp)
```

use.value.labels

factor is a categorical/nominal valuable



Reading Excel sheets
------------------------

tidyverse


read_excel() reads both xls and xlsx files and detects the format from the extension.

List the sheet names with excel_sheets().

Specify a worksheet by name or number.
`read_excel(xlsx_example, sheet = "chickwts")`

There are various ways to control which cells are read. You can even specify the sheet here, if providing an Excel-style cell range.
`read_excel(xlsx_example, n_max = 3)`

If NAs are represented by something other than blank cells, set the na argument.
`read_excel(xlsx_example, na = "setosa")`


```{r}
help(summary)
```


NULL = not defined


If loops
===============

If loops let you perform a specific action if certain conditions are met. 

```{r}
if(is.numeric(iris$Species)) {
  mean(iris$Species) 
} else {
    str(iris$species)
}



```

Sum summarize the selected values - in this case, the nas in the attenu -> station column


Scatter plot
===============

```{r}
cars$dist

plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)


```

Character vector
====================================================================================================



substring. 

```{r}
help(paste)


help(cat)

help("stringr")
?substr

fn <- "tofu"
nchar(fn)
substr(fn, start= 1, stop=2)

?strsplit

strsplit("cooked tofu", split = " ")

state.name

length(state.name)

substring(state.name, c(1, 5, 9), c(3, 7, 12)) # 


```

Cat - 
"\n" - end of the line 


```{r}
LETTERS == "R" # find if R is true in the dataset
which(LETTERS == "R") # find the space of R in the dataset 

which(ll <- c(T, F, T, NA, F, F, T)) # which finds the index of values/elements in the vector that are true 

```

stringr
----------------------------

Part of tidyverse. Verbs to learn:
str_length() Gives how many characters there are
str_detect() Detect the presence or absence of a pattern in a string
str_count() Count the number of matches in a string 
str_subset() Extract and replace substrings from a character vector
str_locate() Locate the positions of patterns in a string
str_extract() Extract matching patterns from a string
str_match() Extract matched groups from a string
str_replace Replaced matched patterns in a string 
str_c - This function joins two or more vectors element-wise into a single character vector

```{r}
library(stringr)

x <- c("why", "video", "cross", "extra", "deal", "authority")
str_length(x)

str_sub(x, 1, 2)

str_c(x, collapse = NULL)

```

Summary
==============


Today we learned how to create for and if loops, scatterplots. We also learnt more a bout subsetting and creating character vectors. Finally we also spent some time learning how to read a CSV file into r, and different kinds of files, such as stata, spss, and excel.
